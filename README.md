GhostTown README.md
===================

Details
-------
Ghost Town is a 2D arcade-style survival game where you are one person in a deserted town. 
The goal is to survive as long as possible, with infinitely many waves of monsters approaching.

Ghost Town was created as my first ever independently developed 2D video game. 
It is a first take at combining two of my passions... video games, and programming!

Controls
--------
Current controls are,
* Movement: WASD (up, left, down, right)
* Weapon fire: IJKL (up, left, down, right)

You may use the mouse left click for the menu options.

How to Play
-----------
* To start the game, clone the repo onto a local directory. Then run the main.py python file. The rest should work!
* To stop the game, press escape (ESC).
